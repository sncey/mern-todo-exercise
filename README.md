# MERN Todo Typescript Exercise

In this lab, we need to migrate our app from javascript to typescript.
All file extensions are already .ts and `npm start` script is also configured to compile all the typescript code and run it with nodemon.

### Requirements

- use proper typing for the whole project, and never use "any", also make sure you remove already written "any" declaration, and use proper typing for it.
- make sure users can't update/delete other users todos.
- use query params to filter completed todos at "GET /todos"

> ðŸ’¡ Reference: Check this guide on how to use mongoose with typescript [mongoose docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/typescript.html) .

### Starting the app

- cd server
- npm install
- npm start
